One night--it was on </p><p>the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for</p><p> I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered doo</p><p>r, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scar</p><p>let, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I l</p><p>ooked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the</p><p> blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and mann</p><p>er told their o</p><p>wn story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon t</p><p>he scent of some new problem. I rang the bell an</p><p>d was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom </p><p>was; but he was glad, I think, to see me.

A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA  I.   To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predomi</p><p>nates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorr</p><p>ent to his cold, precise but </p><p>admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machi</p><p>ne that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save wit</p><p>h a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives a</p><p>nd actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own </p><p>delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a cr</p><p>ack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his.</p><p> And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious a</p><p>nd questionable memory.  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marria</p><p>ge had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around</p><p> the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, whi</p><p>le Holmes, who loathed every</p><p> form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker</p><p> Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his o</p><p>wn keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteri</p><p>es which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague acco</p><p>unt of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of t</p><p>he Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so d</p><p>elicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his act</p><p>ivity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on </p><p>the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for</p><p> I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered doo</p><p>r, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scar</p><p>let, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I l</p><p>ooked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the</p><p> blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and mann</p><p>er told their o</p><p>wn story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon t</p><p>he scent of some new problem. I rang the bell an</p><p>d was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom </p><p>was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his c</p><p>ase of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his </p><p>singular introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked</p><p>. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\" </p><p> \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you in</p><p>tended to go into harness.\"  \"Then, how do you know?\"  \"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yoursel</p><p>f very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?\"  \"My dear Hol</p><p>mes,\" said I, \"this is too much. You would certainly have been bu</p>", "codeExecutionHistory": {}, "ignoreEncryptDecrypt": true}
