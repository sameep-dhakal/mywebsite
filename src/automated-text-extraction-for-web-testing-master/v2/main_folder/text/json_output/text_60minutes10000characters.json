In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for</p><p> Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take </p><p>it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lov</p><p>er he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things f</p><p>or the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit s</p><p>uch intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack </p><p>in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there</p><p> was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other.</p><p> My own complete happiness, and the home-centred</p><p> interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself mast</p><p>er of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings</p><p> in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and altern</p><p>ating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of h</p><p>is own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied </p><p>his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues,</p><p> and clearing up those myst</p><p>eries which had </p><p>been abandoned as hopeless by the offic</p><p>ial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in t</p><p>he case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at </p><p>Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared w</p><p>ith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now</p><p> returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon</p><p> his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more.

In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for</p><p> Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take </p><p>it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lov</p><p>er he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things f</p><p>or the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit s</p><p>uch intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack </p><p>in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there</p><p> was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other.</p><p> My own complete happiness, and the home-centred</p><p> interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself mast</p><p>er of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings</p><p> in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and altern</p><p>ating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of h</p><p>is own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied </p><p>his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues,</p><p> and clearing up those myst</p><p>eries which had </p><p>been abandoned as hopeless by the offic</p><p>ial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in t</p><p>he case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at </p><p>Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared w</p><p>ith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now</p><p> returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind.

Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared w</p><p>ith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now</p><p> returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon</p><p> his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more.

In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for</p><p> Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take </p><p>it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lov</p><p>er he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things f</p><p>or the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit s</p><p>uch intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack </p><p>in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there</p><p> was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other.</p><p> My own complete happiness, and the home-centred</p><p> interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself mast</p><p>er of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings</p><p> in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and altern</p><p>ating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of h</p><p>is own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied </p><p>his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues,</p><p> and clearing up those myst</p><p>eries which had </p><p>been abandoned as hopeless by the offic</p><p>ial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in t</p><p>he case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at </p><p>Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared w</p><p>ith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now</p><p> returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon</p><p> his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fan</p><p>cy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\"  \"Then, how do you know?\"  \"I see it, I de</p><p>duce it.

Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared w</p><p>ith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.

As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon</p><p> his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more.

In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for</p><p> Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take </p><p>it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lov</p><p>er he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things f</p><p>or the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit s</p><p>uch intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack </p><p>in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there</p><p> was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other.</p><p> My own complete happiness, and the home-centred</p><p> interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself mast</p><p>er of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings</p><p> in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and altern</p><p>ating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of h</p><p>is own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied </p><p>his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues,</p><p> and clearing up those myst</p><p>eries which had </p><p>been abandoned as hopeless by the offic</p><p>ial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in t</p><p>he case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at </p><p>Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared w</p><p>ith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now</p><p> returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon</p><p> his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fan</p><p>cy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\"  \"Then, how do you know?\"  \"I see it, I de</p><p>duce it.

As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon</p><p> his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more.

To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more.

In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for</p><p> Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take </p><p>it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lov</p><p>er he would have placed himself in a false position.

But for the trained reasoner to admit s</p><p>uch intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack </p><p>in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there</p><p> was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other.</p><p> My own complete happiness, and the home-centred</p><p> interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself mast</p><p>er of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings</p><p> in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and altern</p><p>ating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of h</p><p>is own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied </p><p>his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues,</p><p> and clearing up those myst</p><p>eries which had </p><p>been abandoned as hopeless by the offic</p><p>ial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in t</p><p>he case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at </p><p>Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared w</p><p>ith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now</p><p> returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon</p><p> his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fan</p><p>cy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\"  \"Then, how do you know?\"  \"I see it, I de</p><p>duce it.

In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for</p><p> Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take </p><p>it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lov</p><p>er he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things f</p><p>or the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit s</p><p>uch intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack </p><p>in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there</p><p> was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other.</p><p> My own complete happiness, and the home-centred</p><p> interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself mast</p><p>er of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings</p><p> in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and altern</p><p>ating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of h</p><p>is own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied </p><p>his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues,</p><p> and clearing up those myst</p><p>eries which had </p><p>been abandoned as hopeless by the offic</p><p>ial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in t</p><p>he case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at </p><p>Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared w</p><p>ith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now</p><p> returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon</p><p> his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fan</p><p>cy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\"  \"Then, how do you know?\"  \"I see it, I de</p><p>duce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?\"  \"My dear Holmes,\" said I, \"this is too</p><p> much.

In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for</p><p> Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take </p><p>it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lov</p><p>er he would have placed himself in a false position.

Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack </p><p>in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there</p><p> was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other.</p><p> My own complete happiness, and the home-centred</p><p> interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself mast</p><p>er of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings</p><p> in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and altern</p><p>ating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of h</p><p>is own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied </p><p>his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues,</p><p> and clearing up those myst</p><p>eries which had </p><p>been abandoned as hopeless by the offic</p><p>ial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in t</p><p>he case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at </p><p>Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared w</p><p>ith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now</p><p> returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon</p><p> his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fan</p><p>cy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\"  \"Then, how do you know?\"  \"I see it, I de</p><p>duce it.

In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for</p><p> Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take </p><p>it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lov</p><p>er he would have placed himself in a false position.

Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack </p><p>in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there</p><p> was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other.</p><p> My own complete happiness, and the home-centred</p><p> interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself mast</p><p>er of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings</p><p> in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and altern</p><p>ating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of h</p><p>is own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied </p><p>his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues,</p><p> and clearing up those myst</p><p>eries which had </p><p>been abandoned as hopeless by the offic</p><p>ial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in t</p><p>he case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at </p><p>Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared w</p><p>ith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now</p><p> returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon</p><p> his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fan</p><p>cy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\"  \"Then, how do you know?\"  \"I see it, I de</p><p>duce it.

In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for</p><p> Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take </p><p>it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lov</p><p>er he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things f</p><p>or the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit s</p><p>uch intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack </p><p>in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there</p><p> was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other.</p><p> My own complete happiness, and the home-centred</p><p> interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself mast</p><p>er of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings</p><p> in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and altern</p><p>ating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of h</p><p>is own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied </p><p>his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues,</p><p> and clearing up those myst</p><p>eries which had </p><p>been abandoned as hopeless by the offic</p><p>ial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in t</p><p>he case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at </p><p>Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared w</p><p>ith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now</p><p> returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon</p><p> his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fan</p><p>cy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\"  \"Then, how do you know?\"  \"I see it, I de</p><p>duce it.

In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for</p><p> Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind.

But for the trained reasoner to admit s</p><p>uch intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack </p><p>in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there</p><p> was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other.</p><p> My own complete happiness, and the home-centred</p><p> interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself mast</p><p>er of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings</p><p> in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and altern</p><p>ating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of h</p><p>is own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied </p><p>his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues,</p><p> and clearing up those myst</p><p>eries which had </p><p>been abandoned as hopeless by the offic</p><p>ial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in t</p><p>he case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at </p><p>Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared w</p><p>ith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now</p><p> returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon</p><p> his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fan</p><p>cy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\"  \"Then, how do you know?\"  \"I see it, I de</p><p>duce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?\"  \"My dear Holmes,\" said I, \"this is too</p><p> much.

And yet there</p><p> was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other.</p><p> My own complete happiness, and the home-centred</p><p> interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself mast</p><p>er of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings</p><p> in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and altern</p><p>ating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of h</p><p>is own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied </p><p>his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues,</p><p> and clearing up those myst</p><p>eries which had </p><p>been abandoned as hopeless by the offic</p><p>ial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in t</p><p>he case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at </p><p>Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared w</p><p>ith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now</p><p> returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon</p><p> his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fan</p><p>cy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\"  \"Then, how do you know?\"  \"I see it, I de</p><p>duce it.

My marriage had drifted us away from each other.</p><p> My own complete happiness, and the home-centred</p><p> interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself mast</p><p>er of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings</p><p> in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and altern</p><p>ating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of h</p><p>is own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied </p><p>his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues,</p><p> and clearing up those myst</p><p>eries which had </p><p>been abandoned as hopeless by the offic</p><p>ial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in t</p><p>he case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at </p><p>Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared w</p><p>ith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now</p><p> returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon</p><p> his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fan</p><p>cy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\"  \"Then, how do you know?\"  \"I see it, I de</p><p>duce it.

And yet there</p><p> was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other.</p><p> My own complete happiness, and the home-centred</p><p> interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself mast</p><p>er of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings</p><p> in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and altern</p><p>ating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of h</p><p>is own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied </p><p>his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues,</p><p> and clearing up those myst</p><p>eries which had </p><p>been abandoned as hopeless by the offic</p><p>ial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in t</p><p>he case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at </p><p>Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared w</p><p>ith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now</p><p> returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon</p><p> his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fan</p><p>cy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\"  \"Then, how do you know?\"  \"I see it, I de</p><p>duce it.

In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for</p><p> Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take </p><p>it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lov</p><p>er he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things f</p><p>or the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions.

Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack </p><p>in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there</p><p> was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other.</p><p> My own complete happiness, and the home-centred</p><p> interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself mast</p><p>er of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings</p><p> in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and altern</p><p>ating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of h</p><p>is own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied </p><p>his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues,</p><p> and clearing up those myst</p><p>eries which had </p><p>been abandoned as hopeless by the offic</p><p>ial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in t</p><p>he case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at </p><p>Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared w</p><p>ith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now</p><p> returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon</p><p> his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fan</p><p>cy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\"  \"Then, how do you know?\"  \"I see it, I de</p><p>duce it.

A SCANDA</p><p>L IN BOHEMIA  I.   To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any othe</p><p>r name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for</p><p> Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take </p><p>it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lov</p><p>er he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things f</p><p>or the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit s</p><p>uch intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack </p><p>in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there</p><p> was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other.</p><p> My own complete happiness, and the home-centred</p><p> interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself mast</p><p>er of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings</p><p> in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and altern</p><p>ating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of h</p><p>is own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied </p><p>his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues,</p><p> and clearing up those myst</p><p>eries which had </p><p>been abandoned as hopeless by the offic</p><p>ial police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in t</p><p>he case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at </p><p>Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared w</p><p>ith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now</p><p> returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which</p><p> must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to kn</p><p>ow how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly </p><p>lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against</p><p> the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon</p><p> his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitu</p><p>de and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly be</p><p>en in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I thin</p><p>k, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a</p><p> spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular </p><p>introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should hav</p><p>e thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fan</p><p>cy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\"  \"Then, how do you know?\"  \"I see it, I de</p><p>duce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?\"  \"My dear Holmes,\" said I, \"this is too</p><p> much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few</p><p> centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, </p><p>and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how </p><p>you work it out.\"  He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.  \"It is simplicity itself,\" said he; \"my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left </p><p>shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by s</p><p>omeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in ord</p><p>er to remove crusted mud from it.
