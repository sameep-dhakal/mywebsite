He was s</p><p>till, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of obse</p><p>rvation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summo</p><p>ns to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothe</p><p>rs at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family</p><p> of Holland.

He was s</p><p>till, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of obse</p><p>rvation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.
