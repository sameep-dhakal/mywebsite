No! Never. I wanted to play. The quote I had heard from my schools band recited in my head. 'Pain is worth the gain.'

They said the pain should have been excrusciating, not something I should have been able to have just shrugged off. After the first surgery, they determined the bone was the consisticy of cottage cheese and that I would need a new one. I would have to wait for someone to die in order to be able to have a working knee once again. It of course was not ideal, but there was no other option.

After the first surgery, they determined the bone was the consisticy of cottage cheese and that I would need a new one.
