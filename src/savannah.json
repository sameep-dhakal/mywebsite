Faith was important to her and while she did struggle falling off of her faith in her stories, it never changed who she was as a person. Reasoning was important in her stories but her selflessness is what attracted peoples attention. “No matter how often Sor Juana admits that her intellectual longings amount to a form of ”vice,\" she embodies in her prose the energy and the vividness that they generate\" (<i>Sor Juana Ines De La Cruz</i> pg.240).&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"line-height:2;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\">Overall, both of these stories are completely different but both focus on the same idea. They both show that reasoning should never be enough. Happiness is what <i>Tartuffe</i> attempts to show with reasoning but with emotions of hypocrisy. It gave a change of thought in the end when the realization of not having to follow every single rule even if it seems that is the true way to happiness. Dorine played the most important role in my opinion because it seemed as if she was already in the modern times by giving feedback even as a housekeeper. Sor Juana shows female struggles and how she had to work with herself and her faith. She shows that even if you come from nothing, there is something you can make of yourself no matter who you are. Neither of these stories sound like they came from a period of reasoning. Both of them give the same thoughts but just in different ways of thinking.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"line-height:2;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"line-height:2;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"line-height:2;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"line-height:2;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"line-height:2;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"line-height:2;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"line-height:2;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"line-height:2;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"line-height:2;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"line-height:2;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"line-height:2;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"line-height:2;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"line-height:2;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"line-height:2;text-align:center;\">&nbsp;</p>","codeExecutionHistory":{},"documentUUID":"2023-09-11-00-59_ENG_2013__World_Lit_66b8ab1a-d5af-4e3e-b0eb-abe5ce256302","deletionToken":"2023-09-11-00-59_ENG_2013__World_Lit_9b7b2250-11c7-47f2-a67d-ddcfe6865db5","dashboardAccessToken":null,"creationDate":"2023-09-12T13:08:16.164Z","questionID":null,"reportUrl":"https://www.processfeedback.org/report/text_2023-09-11-00-59_ENG_2013__World_Lit_66b8ab1a-d5af-4e3e-b0eb-abe5ce256302?lang=en&theme=BlackRedWhite","workspaceUrl":"https://www.processfeedback.org/?theme=BlackRedWhite&cid=ENG%202013:%20World%20Lit&cdesc=Paper%201&type=text&editor=writing"},"required":["documentVersion","formType"],"ignoreEncryptDecrypt":true}
